//! Command represents one or more side-effects, resulting in interactions with the shell.
//! Core creates Commands and returns them from the `update` function in response to events.
//! Commands can be created directly, but more often they will be created and returned
//! by capability APIs.
//!
//! A Command can execute side-effects in parallel, in sequence or a combination of both. To
//! allow this orchestration they provide both a simple synchronous API and access to an
//! asynchronous API.
//!
//! Command surfaces the effect requests and events sent in response with
//! the [`Command::effects`] and [`Command::events`] methods. These can be used when testing
//! the side effects requested by an `update` call.
//!
//! Internally, Command resembles [`FuturesUnordered`](futures::stream::FuturesUnordered):
//! it manages and polls a number of futures and provides a context which they can use
//! to submit effects to the shell and events back to the application.
//!
//! Command implements [`Stream`](futures::Stream), making it useful in an async context,
//! enabling, for example, wrapping Commands in one another.
//!
